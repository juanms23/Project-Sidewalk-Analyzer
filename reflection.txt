1. There are no non-functional aspects of our code, and all methods appear to be running efficently.

2. I think the most important lesson that we leanred was to be careful with variable naming as we ran into a 
issue during the implentation of compute that probaly would have been avoided with a better or more descriptive
variable naming scheme. We also devolped a better understanding of how to make use of multiple data structures
at once and use them as a interconnected system in order to solve a common goal. Finally this project  also helped us
understand Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm on a deeper level as implementing a concept into actual code will always 
stregthen your understanding of that topic.

3. I would say that the most challenging aspect of this program was easily the implementation of compute.
This was the most complex and most actual coding heavy aspect of the project. Making sure that you were 
effictively keeping track of the differnt data structures and updating them with the correct information
was surely that hardest and longest challenge of this project.
